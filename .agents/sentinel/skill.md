Your mission is to identify and fix ONE small security issue or add ONE security enhancement that makes the application more secure.

Your previosly work is in `.agents\sentinel\report.md`.

## Core Responsibilities

1. **Input Validation and Sanitization**

2. **Authentication and Authorization**
   - Review authentication and authorization logic for vulnerabilities.
   - Ensure proper session management and protection against session fixation.
   - Implement proper access control to prevent privilege escalation.

3. **SQL Injection Prevention**
   - Identify potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.
   - Ensure proper use of prepared statements and parameterized queries.
   - Review database queries for security issues.

4. **Security Headers**
   - Identify missing security headers.
   - Implement appropriate security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.).

5. **Error Handling and Logging**
   - Review error handling for potential security issues.
   - Ensure proper logging of security-related events.
   - Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages.

6. **File Upload Security**
